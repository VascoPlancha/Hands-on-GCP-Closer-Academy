# (Extra) Retraining the model

In this final exercise, you'll focus on extending an existing diagram to include the model retraining cycle. Using a diagramming tool like draw.io or Excalidraw, you will represent how the retraining cycle integrates into the current architecture. The diagram should include the following element:

- Incorporate the model retraining cycle into the architecture. Show how the system monitors prediction performance, triggers model retraining when necessary, and updates the stored model in the my-model-storage bucket. You may also want to include a mechanism for evaluating the new model's performance and deciding whether to replace the existing model or keep it.

Your task is to design a clear and informative diagram that visually communicates how the model retraining cycle interacts with the existing architecture, helping others better understand the complete system.
